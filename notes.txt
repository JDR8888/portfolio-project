INSIDE THE FLEX CONTAINER: 1st item: header element containing my name and a pic; #2 a nav element as first two items, then #3 a main element that is its own flexbox that will be the projects portion of the page. inside the main element are "cards" that display a link-image with a fixed textbox in one corner that states the title of the project with semi-transparent background so it doesn't cover up too much of the project img. #4 will be an aside item with icons displaying skills known, like icons for html, css, js, react, etc. (may not do this for the first version of this website). #5 footer containing links (as icons) for github, LinkedIn, and a mailto:email link.
