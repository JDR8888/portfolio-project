INSIDE THE FLEX CONTAINER: 
1st item: header element containing my name and a pic; 
#2 a nav element as first two items, then 
#3 a main element that is its own flexbox that will be the projects portion of the page.        
    inside the main element are "cards" that display a link-image with a fixed textbox in one corner that states the title of the project with semi-transparent background so it doesn't cover up too much of the project img. 
#4 will be an aside item with icons displaying skills known, like icons for html, css, js, react, etc. (may not do this for the first version of this website). 
#5 footer containing links (as icons) for github, LinkedIn, and a mailto:email link.
